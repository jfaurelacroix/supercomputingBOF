# ‘Reporting metrics for funding - are you really doing it right? readme
It's called a README. We usually use this as a user guide for people who might want to use our stuff. 
[Here's a link to a cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). You can use RStudio to edit this but might as well use VScode, since we're getting you started with a bunch of things.

There are many guides out there with good tips on how to write a good README but you can get started [here](https://blog.datadryad.org/2025/09/09/whats-in-a-readme-why-your-readme-matters-and-how-to-create-the-best-one-possible) and [here](https://github.com/banesullivan/README).

Your first task will be to edit this README using Markdown.

We can even add a webpage if we end up liking this. I'm not sure that it could host the live survey thing. We'll think about it.
